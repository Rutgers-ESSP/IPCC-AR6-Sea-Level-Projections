# Guide to the IPCC AR6 Sea Level Projections

This repo provides guidance for access the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report sea level projections. See [Chapter 9 of the Working Group 1 contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter09.pdf) for more information.

### Available viz Zenodo

* **[IPCC AR6 Sea Level Projections](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5914709):** This data set contains the full set of samples for the global projections, as well as summary relative sea level projections (both with and without the AR6 estimate of background sea level process rates). 
* **[Framework for Assessing Changes To Sea-level (FACTS) modules, scripts, and data for the IPCC AR6 sea level projections](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6419953):** This package contains the Frameworks for Assessing Changes To Sea-level (FACTS) modules, data, and scripts used to produce the sea level projections in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). See [the FACTS GitHub repo](https://github.com/radical-collaboration/facts) for the development version of FACTS.
* **[IPCC AR6 Relative Sea Level Projection P-Boxes](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5914918):** This data set contains relative sea level projections for all of the p-boxes described in AR6 WG1 9.6.3, as well as a variant excluding the AR6 estimates of background sea level change.
* **[IPCC AR6 Relative Sea Level Projection Distributions](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5914931):** This data set contains relative sea level projection distributions for all the workflows described in AR6 WG1 9.6.3.2, as well as distributions for the components contributing to relative sea level change.
* **[IPCC AR6 Relative Sea Level Projections without Background Component](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5967268):** This data set contains relative sea level projections that exclude the background term (representing primarily land subsidence or uplift). It includes probability distributions for all the workflows described in AR6 WG1 9.6.3.2, as well as p-boxes derived from these distributions.

### Other tools

Summary versions of regional projections can also be accessed through the [NASA/IPCC Sea Level Projections Tool](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/ipcc-ar6-sea-level-projection-tool).
